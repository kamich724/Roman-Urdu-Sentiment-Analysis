Code of my Masters thesis in Roman Urdu Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning Techniques


# Abstract 

Sentiment analysis (SA) is a kind of text mining to incorporate context. SA is usually
used to explore and extract unique knowledge from the origin of information for
businesses to grasp the social sentiment about a certain product or service of their brand
while monitoring online discussions/chats. It is an indication of the difference (either
positive or negative) in opinions or one viewpoint. Because the computer keyboard is
designed specifically for English, writing a linguistic expression in a native script is a
simple requirement of the day. As a result, RU is one of the new writing/communication
modes developed by Hindi and Urdu speakers. However, there has been little sentiment
study on Urdu/RU until now.
This study centers around the SA of comments over Social Media Sites in Roman Urdu
through the Machine Learning (ML) approach. This approach highly relies on the type of
algorithms used and the training dataâ€™s peculiarity. We use the latest ML, deep learning
algorithms, and feature engineering techniques: TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words, N-gram,
Word2vec, and GloVe. We used an online social media data set and tagged it as a)
positive, b) negative, or c) neutral by two distinct native and well-versed Urdu speakers
with a 0.95 Cohen's Kappa score. After that, we run three sets of probes for subjectivity
analysis, tertiary categorization,recognition and binary classification. The test is carried
out to evaluate the efficacy of the structure. Accuracy, f1-score, Precision, and Recall are
used to assess the performance. The SVM has a higher level of accuracy than other ML
and DL algorithms in the test.
